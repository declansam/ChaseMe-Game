# ChaseMe-Game

A level and time based GUI game where the player can control the movment of the primary character using keyboard arrows.

The goal is to help the main character, who happens to be John Wick, survive as long as possible. However, the catch is there will be other characters who will be chasing him, and as soon as they get a hold of Wick, the game will be over. Thus, the theme of the game is to help Wick survive.
